# So You Want to Learn Python...

This is an outline of resources that I found useful and share for folks that want to learn programming and data analysis in Python.

### Intro Python

Automate the Boring Stuff
* URL: [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
* Chapters 1-11, Appendices A & B; rest is optional

MIT Intro CS with Python
* URL: [MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/)
* read the slides
* type out the code examples
* lecture videos optional (lecturer is good; slides may suffice if you have some experience)

### Intro data analysis and pandas

Python Data Science Handbook (Vanderplas)
* URL: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html
* Sections 1-4. Section 5 (Machine Learning) optional.

### More Computer Science and General Programming Languages
[Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). 

Harvard’s CS50 course is a gem. It’s a slow burn. The first half of CS50 starts in C. For most people, C won’t be the practical language of choice. It’s still an important language to learn and will pay longer term dividends in your understanding of memory management and data structures. The syntax translates smoothly to other C-style languages (C++, Java, C#, JavaScript). For example, the use of curly braces for code blocks, C-style loops, and type declarations are patterns that reoccur across languages you will likely encounter if you venture outside Python. I think this course is a great confidence-builder for your programming skills and broad understanding of how computers and the internet work.

For “why C?”, you can read the instructor’s response here: [Answer to Why does CS50 at Harvard use C as its primary language? by David J. Malan](https://quorasessionswithdavidjmalan.quora.com/Why-does-CS50-at-Harvard-use-C-as-its-primary-language-1?ch=15&oid=20631502&share=1fc21675&srid=2S7W&target_type=answer)
