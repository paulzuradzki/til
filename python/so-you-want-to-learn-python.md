# So You Want to Learn Python...

This is an outline of resources that I found useful and share for folks that want to learn programming and data analysis in Python.

### Intro Python

Automate the Boring Stuff
* URL: [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
* Chapters 1-11, Appendices A & B; rest is optional

MIT Intro CS with Python
* URL: [MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/)
* read the slides
* type out the code examples
* lecture videos optional (lecturer is good; slides may suffice if you have some experience)

### Intro data analysis and pandas

Python Data Science Handbook (Vanderplas)
* URL: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html
* Sections 1-4. Section 5 (Machine Learning) optional.

Ted Petrou series - "Selecting Subsets"
* [Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas: Part 1](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c)
* [Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas: Part 2](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c)
* [Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas: Part 3](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-part-3-d5704b4b9116)
* [Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas: Part 4](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-part-4-c4216f84d388)
* [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428)

Tom Augspurger series (intermediate/advanced)
* ["Modern Pandas"](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro.html)

### More Computer Science and General Programming Languages
[Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). I started auditing CS50 by watching the lectures on long plane flights. This is a less direct route to learning Python per se because CS50 starts out in C and tours a bunch of other languages (including Python). I still highly recommend CS50 if you're coming from a non-traditional CS backround. It's very easy to go from C to Python due to easier syntax and how you get many utilities in Python for free (garbage collection, loose typing, etc). C is a small language and many other languages -- C++, Java, JavaScript -- borrow from C syntax (ex: curly braces, C-style loops, and type declarations). This means if you venture outside of Python, it's often easier to pick up those languages too after learning C.
