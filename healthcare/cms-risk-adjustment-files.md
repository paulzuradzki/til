### CMS Risk Adjustment Files
* MMR - member-level file with monthly risk scores and revenues for the member as CMS sees it. Includes risk segment for scoring.
* MAO4s - Encounter-level information with risk adjustable and non-adjustable claims and diagnoses.
    * Non-adjustable claims can be used as part of audit to inspect potentially missed claims. Ex: zero-dollar amount on required claim line.  
* RAPS - This is the old MAO4 and only include risk adjustable diagnoses.
* MORs - member-level HCC flagging for member's conditions, gender, age, ESRD, disability status
